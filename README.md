# [dotnet] Lab Arquitetura - v2

## Roadmap
- Concise Business Core isolation
- At least a minimal code reusability and standardization
- Define a starting point to solve common problems but it's not a final solution
- to be continued ...

## Constraints
- Database agnostic but designed primarilly for adopting Microsoft Entity Framework
- Frontend framework agnostic but designed primarilly for adopting SPA like Angular, Vue and React
- to be continued ...

## The design explained
<p>This design IS NOT a silver bullet but a starting point to help discover the real design as the programming evolves and rules and problems are better understood and new scenarios and/or technical issues come up.</p>
<p>Even thought some names could indicate, it is not exactly a DDD implementation as defined by Eric Evans<sup>1</sup>. It is a layered design that adopt known patterns as it was done in DDD, but not intending to name as new solution or marketable name to help saling as something totally new.</p>
